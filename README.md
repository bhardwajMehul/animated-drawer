### IDEA  
The idea behind the drawer is to pass it into layout of the navigator so that it can be on the top of all navigators. We have created a stack navigator to control the top drawer and passed the tab into it so that the first renders the tab and we have all the navigators nested into it. We have used react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler for the animating the drawer.
